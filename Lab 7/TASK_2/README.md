# Why the .venv Folder Should Not Be Committed
The .venv (virtual environment) directory contains system-specific dependencies and configurations that are tailored to the machine where it was created. Including it in version control can lead to unnecessary clutter, platform compatibility issues, and bloated repositories.

In real-world projects, it's a best practice to exclude the .venv folder from Git by adding it to .gitignore. Instead, developers share a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml file, which defines the exact packages and versions needed to recreate the environment. This approach ensures that anyone cloning the project can create a clean and consistent environment using:\
```bash
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
